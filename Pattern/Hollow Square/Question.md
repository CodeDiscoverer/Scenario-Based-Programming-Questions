Scenario:

Sarah is fascinated by patterns and wants to create a Java program that prints a square pattern with stars (*) for the corners and spaces for the interior. She envisions a program that allows her to adjust the size of the square pattern. Sarah's friend Erin, who is experienced in programming, offers to help her with this task. Together, they work on creating a Java program to generate square patterns.

Question:

Sarah and Erin are enthusiastic about creating square patterns using Java. They want to create a program that prints a square pattern with stars (*) at the corners and spaces in the interior. The size of the square should be adjustable.

Your task is to implement a Java program that fulfills Sarah's vision:

1. Display a square pattern of stars and spaces based on the value of `n`, where `n` represents the size of the square.
2. The program should print stars (*) for the corners and spaces for the interior.
3. You can use nested loops to achieve this pattern.

Here's an example of what the program should print when `n` is set to 4:


****
*  *
*  *
****


Your program should be able to adjust the size of the square pattern based on the value of `n`.

Additionally, you can suggest potential improvements or optimizations to make the program more efficient or user-friendly.

This question challenges you to create a Java program to generate square patterns and helps Sarah in her quest for creating interesting patterns.
