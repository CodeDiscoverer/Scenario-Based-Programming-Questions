Scenario:

Sarah is working on a project where she needs to print a unique square pattern. She envisions a pattern consisting of three asterisks (***) in each row, forming a square. Sarah is new to programming and is seeking help from her experienced friend, Erin, to create a Java program that generates this pattern.

Question:

Sarah is eager to create a Java program that generates a square pattern using three asterisks (***) in each row. The pattern should look like this:

```
***
***
***
```

Your task is to write a Java program that fulfills Sarah's vision:

1. Display the square pattern as shown above.
2. The program should allow Sarah to specify the size of the square, i.e., the number of rows and columns.

Your program should be able to generate the specified square pattern with the desired number of rows and columns.

Additionally, you can suggest potential improvements or modifications to make the program more versatile or user-friendly.

This question challenges you to create a Java program that prints a unique square pattern according to Sarah's requirements.
